Here's an minor update of RepShell, v 0.3.3 (EXE also included in the Zip)

The changes in this update are these:

There has changed a lot since the last time it was up.

Features: 	- Fully enabled taskbox with cool buttons

- Automatic drive recognition and listing

- direct access to all folders

- Context menus for desktop items

- Arrow navigation on desktop and in menus

- Choose your own colors for menus

- Very fast file searching

- ability to make RepShell default shell from the option form

- Option form to change a lot of settings

- Working desktop refreshing

- File size seriously reduced

- Added item to context menu of desktopitems to rename them, this is not a standard windows function

- Simple DUN functions

- Started adding multimedia functions but decided it would be better to make that a new project

I will be posting this one soon

Even if you don't like the program there's a lot you can learn from here.

It's up to you guys to fully test it. Please leave comments.

If you're an experienced programmer take a look at questions.txt for some

issues i'm having trouble with. Maybe you can help me out.
