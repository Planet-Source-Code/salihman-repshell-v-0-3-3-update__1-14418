- How do I make a window bottom most and let it stay there without a flickering ?

- How can I make the frmStart form detect when another program or form has got the focus
  and unload itself, rather than putting the unloadcode in all the other subs and functions?

- How can I draw the focus rect around the label in a different style, with the API 
  DrawFocusRect ?

- How do you properly use the Form - DrawMode Property to erase a line Drawn on the form
  i.e.  DrawMode = ?
	Line (10,10)-(20,20), &HFF
        DrawMode = ?
        Line (10,10)-(20,20), &HFF

	The line should be erased at this point.
